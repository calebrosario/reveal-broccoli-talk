##  What is Broccoli.js?

![picture of the asset pipeline](images/asset_pipeline.png)

This is a new backend-agnostic build tool similar to the Rails asset Pipeline

NOTE:
Last but not least, Broccoli follows the Gulp principle: tasks based on code logic and plugin system for helpers. This time there is no notion of pipe. Itâ€™s about filters you apply to a tree of file. Basically, it requires to select a folder, then apply to it home-made functions of plugin ones. Broccoli relies more on the command line for parameters.

The direct result is that it produces the most concise code of all the build tools discussed here. Unfortunately the code base is not fully stable yet and the community is less active than the Gulp and Grunt ones.
